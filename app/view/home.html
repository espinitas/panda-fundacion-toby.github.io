        I've found really interesting possibilities about hosting just HTML and Javascript
        in Github pages. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        At this moment the first thing that IÂ´m playing with is the capability of creating a Single Application
        Page (SPA) using only Javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        My first experiment will be about using RequireJs and KnockoutJs to build a "Typing Tool". <br />
        This "Typing Tool" is a small application written only with HTML, and a little bit of KnockoutJS.
    </p>
    <p>
        Click on the left side menu to go there, <a data-bind="click: function(){
                                return navigate('typetool');
                            }" href="#typetool">or follow this link</a>.
